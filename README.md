# NewsApplication-Project2

I created a news app.

You can check your the news based category

I did not use storyboard in this project(Programmatically)

You can get latest news and go to news link.

Although I use many swift language features, my purpose in this application was programmatically coding and using Alamofire.

I'm leaving below some images of the application.
